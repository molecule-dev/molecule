'@molecule/api-ai-tools': patch
---

Secret redaction no longer rewrites ordinary source. File reads and search results now redact only `NAME=value` env assignments, so code such as `auth={authClient}` or `apiKeys: 'API keys'` is returned verbatim instead of as `[REDACTED]`. Command output and `.env` reads keep the full env-dump treatment. New exports: `redactSecretsInCode`, `isEnvFilePath`.
