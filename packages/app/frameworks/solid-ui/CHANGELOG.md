# @molecule/app-ui-solid

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- The Vue, Solid and Angular UI packages export every `@molecule/app-ui-react` component with the same names, props, markup and behavior, and each UI package declares its framework binding, and every package its types reference, as a peer.

### Patch Changes

- UI components re-render their translated text on a locale switch, as `@molecule/app-ui-react` does; `@molecule/app-angular`'s `useTranslation().t` and `useT()` make the view that calls them follow a locale switch.
- Components read auth, routing, theme and translation through the framework binding (`@molecule/app-vue`, `@molecule/app-solid`) instead of a private copy of its accessors, so the binding's translated errors and fixes apply to them.

## 1.0.6

### Patch Changes

- Align generated API documentation with source declarations and signatures.

## 1.0.5

### Patch Changes

- Preserve authored TypeScript declarations in generated API documentation.

## 1.0.3

### Patch Changes

- 7857fd8: Dependencies updated: both bindings are now tested against solid-js 1.9.17, which resolves the patched seroval 1.6.x.

## 1.0.1

### Patch Changes

- Ship the generated package documentation.

  1.0.0 published with `files: ["dist"]`, so no package carried a README and every
  npm page read "This package does not have a README". The generated doc (formerly
  MOLECULE.md, now README.md) is now included in the tarball, giving both humans and
  coding agents the full API reference from node_modules.

- Updated dependencies
  - @molecule/app-i18n@1.0.1
  - @molecule/app-icons@1.0.1
  - @molecule/app-ui@1.0.1
