/**
 * Svelte UI class generators for molecule.dev.
 *
 * Provides class generators, variant maps, and utility functions for building
 * Svelte components that implement the `@molecule/app-ui` component interfaces
 * using the UIClassMap abstraction from `@molecule/app-ui`.
 *
 * Unlike the React and Vue packages which export framework-specific components,
 * this package exports pure TypeScript utilities that Svelte components consume
 * to generate their class strings.
