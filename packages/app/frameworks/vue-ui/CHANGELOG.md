# @molecule/app-ui-vue

## 1.0.3

### Patch Changes

- e15c19a: Fleet audit fixes: add `borderL` and `alertLeftAccent` class-map tokens, implement the previously-dropped Alert `variant="left-accent"` (status-colored 4px leading bar, React + Vue), and change the button icon/spinner spacing tokens from `mr-2`/`ml-2` to `shrink-0` (the button's own `gap` already provides spacing — the stacked margins made icons sit off-center).

## 1.0.1

### Patch Changes

- Ship the generated package documentation.

  1.0.0 published with `files: ["dist"]`, so no package carried a README and every
  npm page read "This package does not have a README". The generated doc (formerly
  MOLECULE.md, now README.md) is now included in the tarball, giving both humans and
  coding agents the full API reference from node_modules.

- Updated dependencies
  - @molecule/app-i18n@1.0.1
  - @molecule/app-icons@1.0.1
  - @molecule/app-ui@1.0.1
